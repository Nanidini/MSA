Michael and Nandini to collaborate on a proposal for how we should structure the team git repository 

Include in this proposal: 
How should push requests / pull requests be handled? 
Conflict resolution - (I am happy to coordinate the merging and resolving of conflicts as I am the most experienced with the codebase ðŸ™‚)
When should branches be made / pruned?
Any other detail you think is necessary for a painless (or as painless as possible!) experience for the whole team - we'll be sharing the git with Daniel, David, Bhargavi, Irene, CJ and Thi as well, so make sure you keep that in mind! Those 6 will be working on fairly distinct projects from us, but still in the same codebase.
One particular pain point in the git branches currently is the packages directory (as we saw when getting you set up!) - is there a better way we can handle this?
